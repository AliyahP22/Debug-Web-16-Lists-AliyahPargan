<h2>An ordered HTML list</h2>
<!--The problem here is they put the ending tag of the ul tag instead of the beginning tag at the front. They also need to add numbers since it is a ordered list, which I fixed-->
<ol type="I">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>  
<h2>An unordered HTML list</h2>
<!--The problem was in the unordered list, there is a square next to the word "tea"instead of next to all of them. They forgot to do <ul styles> and make code for the list, which I fixed it.They also forgot to put the beginning li tagin line 15 and for line 17, they put l1 instead of li.-->
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
 <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
